**Financial Inclusion in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania.
Research Question**

The research problem is to figure out how we can predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, while providing insights into some of the key demographic factors that might drive individualsâ€™ financial outcomes.

**Metrics for Success**

Determine insights on the demographic factors that drive individuals' financial outcomes.

Design model that will be used to predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account.

**Understanding the context**

Financial Inclusion remains one of the main obstacles to economic and human development in Africa. For example, across Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda only 9.1 million adults (or 13.9% of the adult population) have access to or use a commercial bank account.

Traditionally, access to bank accounts has been regarded as an indicator of financial inclusion. Despite the proliferation of mobile money in Africa and the growth of innovative fintech solutions, banks still play a pivotal role in facilitating access to financial services. Access to bank accounts enables households to save and facilitate payments while also helping businesses build up their credit-worthiness and improve their access to other financial services. Therefore, access to bank accounts is an essential contributor to long-term economic growth.
